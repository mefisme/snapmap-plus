/* commands.h -- clone of SnapHak's console-COMMAND surface, native C
 * (port of OG XINPUT1_3 FUN_1800229b1's AddCommand spine + the per-command handlers).
 *
 * OG registers 22 console commands with the engine cmd system via idCmdSystemLocal::AddCommand
 * (engine 0x1AA3630), each dispatching to its handler. We collapse OG's static-init std::vector
 * machinery to one install fn that calls the engine AddCommand directly per command -- no hardcoded
 * RVAs (the engine fns are signature-resolved by the signature resolver; the idCmdSystemLocal* global is
 * decoded build-portably from a sig'd accessor's RIP-relative MOV, the same LEA-decode idiom sh_strids
 * uses for its table global).
 *
 * All 22 OG command NAMES plus eight Snapmap+ additions are registered (Tier B/C handlers are
 * faithful "not yet implemented in clone" stubs that print the OG help). The trivial handlers wire to
 * the ALREADY-SHIPPED
 * ops: sh_rawmaps_on/off (OG snapHak_rawmaps_on/off) -> sh_rawmap_swap_arm. Later tranches
 * fill the decl/entity/type handlers.
 *
 * ABI (DIRECT, from the engine command-register decompiles):
 *   AddCommand(cmdsys, name, handler, help, argComp, flags)   -- we pass argComp=NULL, flags=0.
 *   handler is __fastcall(idCmdArgs*); argc @ +0x00, argv[N] @ +0x08 + 8*N.
 *   console output goes through idCommon dispatch (Printf sig 0x1A08E80) via the OG wrapper form
 *   (*(engineBase+0x1a08e80))(1, fmt, &va) -- we pre-format then call (1, "%s", &bufptr).
 *
 * Clean-room: ported from our own RE (the engine register-ABI is documented in the
 * AddCommand ABI block above). Zero OG SnapHak bytes.
