# Architecture

Snapmap+ ships a backend DLL loaded by DOOM and a WebView2 companion DLL. The
backend owns engine integration; the frontend owns presentation and forwards
engine work through their shared interface. The Go installer deploys the pair.

This guide explains component boundaries and contributor constraints. Detailed
backend algorithms and reverse-engineering evidence belong beside their code or
in the snaphak-re findings system.

## Components and entry points

| Component | Responsibility | Start reading |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | Bootstrap, hooks, editor operations, packages and installed-resource access. | `src/backend/dllmain.c` |
| Shared interface | Matched DLL contract, callback bindings and shared queues. | `src/common/snapmap_plus_iface.h` |
| Frontend | Companion window, messages, editor views and preview controls. | [WebView UI](webview-ui.md) |
| Fault shield | Selected engine-fault recovery and local crash evidence. | `src/fault_shield/fault_shield.c` |
| Installer | Verified deployment, migration, update and uninstall. | [Installer README](../installer/README.md) |
| Website services | Community authentication/content and feedback relay. | [Services](services.md), [feedback](feedback.md) |

The backend is an XInput proxy named `XINPUT1_3.dll`. It forwards controller calls
to the system library and initializes the editor integration. The frontend is
`snapmap-plus-ui.dll`. Both are built and deployed together; mixing their versions
can call the wrong interface slot. See [packaging](packaging.md).

## Engine resolution and patching

Function signatures identify engine code. Generated anchors derive global
addresses from code references. Vulkan and OpenGL share these portable resolution
paths; field layouts still need explicit verification when porting.

A pattern that matches more than once is not an identification. Where two
functions share a body, the caller must confirm its target by something the
pattern cannot carry: the rawmap branch answer follows the call its candidate
makes and reads the literal that callee names, because the sibling it must not
patch differs only there.

A raw-RVA fallback requires an exact fingerprint of a supported reference
executable. The hook-tolerant fallback additionally checks the detour and remaining
signature bytes. A filename or a readable address is not sufficient evidence.
Contributor changes to signatures or anchors require the two-image test gate in
[contributing](contributing.md#7-run-the-tests).

Hook callers prepare a trampoline, publish it as their original callback, then
commit the detour. Preparation does not write the target. Callers own the
lifetime of their original callbacks and any relay memory.
They must preserve those resources until restoration succeeds and no execution
can still use them. Failed rollback remains a recoverable state, not a successful
uninstall. The patch and hook headers define the supported installation and
restoration sequence. Stolen instructions must be complete and independently
executable; the hook helper does not relocate RIP-relative instructions.

## DLL interface

Map rendering lives in the backend and DOOM's native Settings / Properties
panel. The panel owns an Apply/Cancel draft tied to the current editable map.
Apply stores a versioned `smp.render.v1` string in native map variables; the
native serializer carries it through normal saves without a sidecar. The
reserved value contains view distance, fog strength, start/end and linear RGB.
Version 3 stores only these seven values. Version 1 and enabled version 2 values
are read directly; disabled version 2 maps migrate to native defaults. Missing
metadata also uses native defaults. Save/Play conversion writes the current
canonical values without reallocating an unchanged string or shifting variable
indices. Malformed or duplicate metadata disables the
override. The reserved variable should not be edited through generic variables.
Map deserialization clears the previous runtime selection and reads the loaded
map's variables. Editor-to-play conversion refreshes that selection from the
current editable map. A locked value copy crosses to rendering, where the
blended environment's literal view-distance and fog values are changed independently:
view distance 8192 or zero leaves native distance intact, and fog strength zero
leaves native fog intact. Fog range/color values do not enable an override while
strength is zero. The controls are always editable and there is no stored enable
flag. Overrides run before
the engine reads its far clip. This applies only to SnapMap and uses signed
bindings in both renderer executables. No WebView interface change is involved.

Grid Room resizing is implemented in the existing backend. The native DOOM
Module Properties panel owns its XYZ control. In Blueprint mode, the normal
module selection handler adds the native Module Properties prompt and checks
the engine's X action for the highlighted Grid Room. It selects that placement
and enters the native panel state while retaining the Blueprint camera. Tutorial
restrictions, other module types and selection transitions remain guarded.
The WebView has no resizing control or new interface slot. Dimension-bearing
module names resolve through private native palettes and the existing resource
provider. Newly materialized empty catalogs take the native generic source load
before admission; accepted and stock catalogs are not reloaded. The edit handler
changes one compiled placement and translates its owned caps, doors and frames
through the native copy-on-write entity edit and transform setter. This uses the
live local transform, including after a native cap replacement leaves serialized
definition edit state null. Ordinary placed objects keep their local positions and sizes.
Finite XYZ inputs clamp to the per-axis limits and display the applied dimensions.
The current snapEdit_environmentModuleBounds cvar constrains the selected
placement and every connected neighbor on each edit. Planning uses temporary
spatial views and native bounds helpers before creating resources. Signed-short
BCM/AAS coordinates impose independent representation limits, including navigation
outsets beyond the shell. Changing the cvar does not change those formats.
Connected module branches translate rigidly to follow the changed doorways. A
conflicting loop or increased bounding-box overlap prevents the connected edit.
The engine recomputes all portal connections before accepting the transaction;
an unexpected change restores the prior transforms and module records. The room
resources are constructed in memory; no map sidecars are required.

Built-in lights are identified from the installed module's original entity
names and inheritance. Native property-tree setters, commit and cached-property
refresh update their position, coverage and distance cutoffs without changing
authored light properties. The modern effective light center follows the roof;
the classic central light follows the room center. Tree ownership uses the
engine's matching destructor and delete calls, with rollback on edit failure.

The resource provider supplies resized AAS for all three stock agent classes.
Door apertures and agent clearance remain fixed. Narrow strips that collapse
at the shrink minimum are removed with their area references, cover membership,
visibility and route chains remapped. Native BuildAAS performs module placement
and assembly, and marked blocking volumes augment the resized base navigation.

Object-mode containment first uses the native query. If its fixed 6000-unit
vertical rays miss an admitted taller variant, a bounded fallback extends both
rays to that room's height. Both native body hits must identify the same valid
module; world bounds alone never authorize placement. Resizing also refreshes
the native per-module placement-display models inside the process heap scope,
including after rollback. Otherwise Object Mode can retain the previous size's
display resources until the camera is re-entered.

The native XYZ inspector shares a context with Grid Offset. Its base reset
clears values but leaves the range list populated. AddVec3 clears the validated
range count before native construction so each inspector rebuilds its own three
ranges. Allocation ownership stays native; the separate door-cap and portal
minimum checks still determine the smallest accepted room dimensions.

The faint green surface display is the game's navigation-class placement
overlay, separate from the custom blocking-volume preview. The held entity's
native navigation type selects one of three installed display models. Objects
without that type do not request a model. The native material uses world-space
grid coordinates and animated brightness, so its apparent intensity can vary
while the model remains visible. The resize path preserves these native rules.

Reload has a separate palette membership probe; it now shares the variant lookup
so saved rooms reach instance conversion. Cold construction can run before editor
activation once the stock palette and native main-thread heap are available.
Portal magnet snapping corrects the selected group's discarded XY offset only
for compatible equal-size portals involving a variant. Explicit attachment scopes
an exact-origin exception to that operation. Add/move/duplicate confirmation
also preserves off-grid origins in maps containing resized rooms, including a
stock neighbor aligned to one. Native dirty marking and remainder cleanup still
run. Native reciprocal connection checks remain exact; the normal frame updater
replaces caps and creates doors/frames when those connections change.
Private palettes retain their two cached collision resources across map teardown;
their native collision builder runs in the same process heap scope as the palette.
Stock palette collision lifetime remains native. A process holds at most 64
distinct size/type variants, avoiding eviction while maps or undo records may
still reference them. Save files contain the dimension-bearing module identity;
players need Snapmap+ to reconstruct its resources. Vanilla loading is unsupported.

The shared object uses an append-only vtable. Its original 77-slot prefix is
retained, with extensions through `+0x338`; the current table occupies `0x340`
bytes. The last three are the File menu's rawmap surface: `rawmap_status`
(`+0x328`), `rawmap_configure` (`+0x330`) and `rawmap_load_now` (`+0x338`).
Static assertions pin the layout. Do not insert, reorder or repurpose
existing slots. Add new capability slots at the end and update both DLLs.

Headers define buffer ownership, return values and thread requirements. Keep
engine pointers inside the backend where possible. Copy values across the
boundary rather than exposing mutable engine storage. An accepted asynchronous
request is distinct from completed engine work.

## Threads and edit results

The WebView host owns its window and browser callbacks. Its worker polls the
backend through a manual think loop at about 30 Hz. UI callbacks stage requests;
the worker drains them and posts result messages. A UI mutex protects its shared
request state, not the engine's objects.

Package, navigation and staging maintenance run after a successful native engine
frame on DOOM's verified main thread. Recovery suppresses that pass. The frontend
queue drain does not schedule native maintenance or display engine dialogs.

Console `sh` handlers run on the engine's command-execution thread. Synchronous
apply runs inline only when that thread is positively identified as DOOM's main
thread. A known off-main caller copies its batch into the blocking marshal and
waits for the main-thread command drain. Unknown identity, missing transport and
occupied slots refuse the request; they never authorize an inline fallback.

The marshal withdraws work that has not started when its wait expires. If the
engine has started but has not finished by the deadline, it retains the request
and returns `SH_APPLY_IN_PROGRESS`. Callers must not report that as failure or
submit a duplicate. The asynchronous queue likewise refuses a new batch while
its existing pending batch is occupied.

Class/inherit edits snapshot both original pooled strings before assignment.
Result `1` means every requested assignment succeeded; `0` means refusal or
successful rollback; `-2` means rollback also faulted. Only complete success
permits a dependent source rebuild. SEH contains memory faults; it cannot promise
that every native engine operation can be undone.

Prefab Load/Place stages data and queues the native paste action after checking
editor state and the copy/paste cvar. Queue acceptance does not confirm that the
engine has entered placement mode. The engine consumes that action later.

## Engine data ownership

Engine allocators inherit the calling thread's heap scope. Objects retained
across Play or map teardown need a persistent scope; allocating them on a
transient scope can leave apparently valid pointers to released storage. Keep
construction, destruction and heap-scope pairing within the backend operation.

The frontend treats returned data according to each slot's explicit ownership
contract. Preview requests are asynchronous and generation-tagged so an old
completion cannot replace a newer selection. Large serialized results use owned,
growable buffers instead of silently truncating fixed arrays.

Asset browsers and prefab previews read declarations and resources from the
player's installed game and enabled packages. The product does not embed DOOM
assets. Resource caches and package snapshots need explicit reader lifetimes;
rescanning must not invalidate storage a reader or native object still uses.

Navigation snapshots and shipped resource reads run on the engine thread.
The snapshot reader takes collision dimensions from each cloned entity's
resolved declaration while the native snapshot is alive. It pairs declarations
with JSON by array position, preserving inherited sizes and duplicate IDs
without adding fields to saved maps. Only copied geometry reaches the bake.
A worker owns copied preview inputs and performs the arithmetic bake, while the
frame installs only a result matching the current geometry revision. The bake
lock precedes the worker handoff lock; the worker never acquires the bake lock.
Published lines remain until their replacement completes, except during a drag
or after an empty or refused snapshot. Sparse box refreshes include unmarked
obstacles and use live uniqueIds; topology changes require a complete snapshot.
Play always takes its own complete snapshot. The worker and session log handle
have process lifetime; DllMain must not wait on them or acquire their locks.

Navigation surfaces and obstacles have separate roles. The bake emits only
exposed box faces meeting each AAS class's floor-slope threshold; ordinary
Block Demons boxes subtract occupied standing space without adding surfaces.
The engine also registers their clip shapes for native AAS obstacle avoidance.
Its separate expanded blocker registration feeds flight navigation. Keep both
native registrations intact for ordinary walls; a vertical wall does not need
a custom walkable shell. Traversals connect valid approach and landing surfaces.

Native route preparation allows 256 outgoing reachabilities per area. A custom
bake refusal concerns that area's route complexity, not the map's entity count.
It must remain distinguishable from a stale preview or a failed local obstacle
query, either of which can occur while the underlying AAS remains loaded.

Override misses carry the package generation that produced them. A rescan makes
old misses inapplicable even when an earlier lookup completes concurrently.

## Configuration

The backend owns `%LOCALAPPDATA%/snapmap-plus/config.json`, including defaults,
validation, persistence and recovery. UI writes go through the registered config
service. The frontend uses the service's descriptors and values; it does not
maintain a competing settings file.

Initialization validates configuration before dependent subsystems consume it.
Unknown keys are preserved. Invalid input and failed persistence remain visible
through service results. Theme bootstrap may read the existing preference before
the browser is ready, then converges on the backend's published state.

Configuration descriptors in `src/backend/config.c` define available keys and
change behavior. Deleting the file resets preferences at the next startup.
Installer updates and uninstall preserve player configuration.

## Packages and refresh boundaries

A package has a `package.json` marker and can contribute declarations, strings,
resource references and supported settings. Discovery, conflict checking and
native publication are separate operations. Incomplete inventories must not
silently publish a partial package set.

The override provider serves file content and an immutable declaration view.
The declaration server registers new identities and refreshes existing shadows;
the installed-resource bridge supplies data already present in the game. A
package can therefore refer to installed assets without redistributing them.

Boot binds runtime dependencies even when no package declarations are present.
Runtime refresh is a main-thread operation at a settled My Maps browser, with
the editor inactive, no loading transition and no dialog. Unsafe requests remain
pending until these conditions hold. Refresh drains required commands
before native publication. The entire native refresh uses verified process-heap
scope so palette arrays and declaration-owned strings survive map teardown;
resource-level promotion separately retains the engine's resource objects.
Every exit restores the previous heap scope. Failed admission or restoration
keeps package-dependent maps gated.

Refresh includes existing shadows and string changes, not only new declaration
names. Reader synchronization keeps old snapshots valid until readers release
them. Success includes materialization, required visibility and palette refresh;
registration alone is insufficient to authorize loading a package-dependent map.

Map package consent uses the boot inventory plus this session's own authorized
installs. An arbitrary file appearing on disk does not bypass that consent state.
Every required package must satisfy the gate. `decl_server.h`, `overrides.h`,
`resource_bridge.h`, `strids.h` and `map_package.h` define the detailed contracts.

## Failure reporting

The fault shield handles selected, understood engine faults. It does not make
arbitrary native calls safe. Expected recoveries, nonterminal notices and fatal
records have different meanings; a captured record alone does not prove survival.

Crash formatting produces complete JSON or an empty failure. Capture uses bounded
storage and nonblocking guards so nested faults cannot wait on a faulting thread.
A pending record is published only after its temporary file is written completely.
The frontend reads those records for notices or report prompts; network reporting
is handled separately by the [feedback pipeline](feedback.md).

## Changing a boundary

Keep thread, ownership and failure contracts in the relevant header and verify
the production path with focused tests. Use fault injection for rollback and
publication failures, controlled concurrent readers for snapshot changes, and
both executable images for resolver changes. Build both DLLs and test the affected
workflow in DOOM before shipping. See [contributing](contributing.md).
