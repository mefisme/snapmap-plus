# Pure ASCII (PS 5.1 reads BOM-less UTF-8 as 1252).

# This is SnapHak's packaging step: shipping the snaphak\ + platforms\ Qt runtime alongside the two clone
# DLLs is done here. It consumes the DLLs built by build.ps1 (in build\) and copies the Qt 5.9.9
# runtime from the Qt SDK. Output is the 6-file overlay documented in docs\packaging.md, plus a
# MANIFEST.sha256 (the install/verify map + hash transparency for releases).
